Chosen topic: PCA


Requirements:

2/2
- Description of the algorithm, usagess, intuition...
- Python code of the algorithm


3/
- Proof of the mehtod if it is exact, or conditions for convergence
- Discussion for the theoretical complexity of the algorithm 
	(worst, average, best case where it is superior to other algorithms)
- Testing the method on simulated data in a way as to test 
	the speed of the algorithm in different situations
- Testing the method on simulated data in a way as to test 
	the convergence of the algorithm in different situations 
- Testing the mehtod on real data in a way as to check the speed and
	accuracy/reliability of the method on the given data
- Comparison of the speeed and/or the convergency of two methods.
